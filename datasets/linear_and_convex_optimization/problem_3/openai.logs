### PROBLEM INFORMATION:


- Custom Tees is planning an online advertising campaign with \var{A} different ad types across two web companies.

- The company has set a goal of \var{goal_unique_young} thousand unique clicks from visitors aged 18-25 and \var{goal_unique_old} thousand unique clicks from visitors older than 25.
- Ad type \var{a} has an estimated percentage of \var{young_click_{a}} clicks from the 18-25 age range.
- Ad type \var{a} has an estimated percentage of \var{old_click_{a}} clicks from older visitors.
- Ad type \var{a} has a cost of \var{cost_{a}} per 1000 clicks.
- Ad type \var{a} has a maximum allowable clicks of \var{max_click_{a}} in thousands.
- The estimated percentage of unique visitors for each ad type \var{a} is \var{unique_click_{a}}.

}

1. Clearly define the decision variables.
2. Formulate the objective function precisely.
3. List all the constraints, ensuring they are complete and non-redundant.
4. Ensure the formulation is coherent, logical, and solvable.
5. Provide any necessary explanations or clarifications for your formulation.


Please respond with a well-structured mathematical formulation of the given optimization problem, adhering to the instructions and format provided above.
### DECISION VARIABLES:

Let xₐ represent the number of clicks (in thousands) purchased for each ad type a (a ∈ A, where A is the set of all ad types).

### OBJECTIVE FUNCTION:

The objective is to minimize the total cost of the ad campaign. Hence, the objective function is:

Minimize Z = ∑ₐ (costₐ * xₐ) for all a ∈ A

### CONSTRAINTS:

1. The total number of clicks from visitors aged 18-25 should be at least goal_young:

∑ₐ (young_clickₐ * xₐ) ≥ goal_young for all a ∈ A

2. The total number of clicks from visitors older than 25 should be at least goal_old:

∑ₐ (old_clickₐ * xₐ) ≥ goal_old for all a ∈ A

3. The total number of unique clicks from visitors aged 18-25 should be at least goal_unique_young:

∑ₐ (young_clickₐ * unique_clickₐ * xₐ) ≥ goal_unique_young for all a ∈ A

4. The total number of unique clicks from visitors older than 25 should be at least goal_unique_old:

∑ₐ (old_clickₐ * unique_clickₐ * xₐ) ≥ goal_unique_old for all a ∈ A

5. The number of clicks purchased for each ad type should not exceed its maximum allowable clicks:

xₐ ≤ max_clickₐ for all a ∈ A

6. The number of clicks purchased for each ad type should be non-negative (as one cannot purchase a negative number of clicks):

xₐ ≥ 0 for all a ∈ A

### EXPLANATIONS:

1. The objective function is a linear combination of the decision variables (number of clicks purchased for each ad type), which makes the problem a linear programming problem.

2. The constraints ensure that the goals for total and unique clicks from both age groups are met while not exceeding the maximum allowable clicks for each ad type.

3. The non-negativity constraint ensures the feasibility of the solution as it's not possible to purchase a negative number of clicks.I am using a None code in python to formulate and solve this problem. The code, provided below, reads data from a file named "data.json" and writes the output to a file named "output.json". However, a user has reported that the output is incorrect and provided a list of error messages.

### ERROR MESSAGE:

', pessimistically value the context of the past solutions and more importantly the latest generated solution you had AS A FLOAT BETWEEN 0 AND 1

                    Past solutions:


                    ## ERROR EXPLANATION

1. 'Total young clicks 5.0 do not match the goal 500.':

    Observation: The model is generating only 5 thousand clicks from the young age group, but the goal is 500 thousand clicks. There seems to be a scaling issue in the inputs or constraints.
    
    Thoughts: Check if the input data and constraints related to young clicks are defined properly, particularly whether any percentage values are being treated correctly.
    
   
2. 'Total old clicks 6.0 do not match the goal 600.':

    Observation: Similarly, the model is generating only 6 thousand clicks from the older age group, but the goal is 600 thousand clicks. This looks like a similar scaling issue as above.
    
    Thoughts: Check how the input data and constraints related to old clicks are defined, particularly whether any percentage values are being treated correctly.
    

3. 'Total unique young clicks 2.6999999999999997 do not match the goal 250.':

    Observation: The model is generating around 2.7 thousand unique clicks from the young age group, but the goal is 250 thousand unique clicks. This seems to be another scaling issue.
    
    Thoughts: Check if the input data for unique young clicks is defined correctly and whether the corresponding constraints are correctly set.
    

4. 'Total unique old clicks 2.7 do not match the goal 300.':

    Observation: The model is generating around 2.7 thousand unique clicks from the old age group, but the goal is 300 thousand unique clicks. This seems to be a scaling issue.
    
    Thoughts: Check if the input data for unique old clicks is defined correctly and whether the corresponding constraints are correctly set.


## CODE REVIEW AND SUGGESTIONS

Observations:

* In the provided code, there seem to be no glaring issues at first glance.
* The units in the error messages suggest there may be a scaling issue.

Thoughts:

* It's possible that inputs such as costs or click ratios are expressed in different units (e.g., dollars vs. tens of dollars, percentage vs. fraction, and so on).
* Check the value scales of inputs to ensure they are all consistent.
* Validate the data on "young_clicks", "old_clicks", "unique_clicks", and "max_clicks". These may be expected to be in the percentage form (ranging from 0 to 1), but they might instead be given in actual counts (hundreds or thousands).


## RESOLVING THE ERRORS

Observation:

* If the input data's scales are inconsistent or incorrect, it can result in the error messages detailed above.

Thoughts:

* Normalize or scale data inputs consistently if needed. 
* Ensure that both the input data and constraints are specified with correct units.

Recommendation:

* Often, the percentage of clicks in raw data are expressed as decimal numbers (0 <= _ <= 1), but they could also be expressed as actual percentages (0 <= _ <= 100). If this is the case, you will need to divide these inputs by 100 during the constraint definition.
* If the goals (`goal_young`, `goal_old`, `goal_unique_young`, `goal_unique_old`) are defined in terms of thousands, they should be consistent with other inputs and constraints that are also defined per thousand. 


Corrections to the model constraints as follows:

```python
# Constraint for total clicks from young visitors
model.addConstr(quicksum((young_clicks[a]/100)*x[a] for a in A) >= goal_young)

# Constraint for total clicks from old visitors
model.addConstr(quicksum((old_clicks[a]/100)*x[a] for a in A) >= goal_old)

# Constraint for unique clicks from young visitors
model.addConstr(quicksum((young_clicks[a]/100)*unique_clicks[a]*x[a] for a in A) >= goal_unique_young)

# Constraint for unique clicks from old visitors
model.addConstr(quicksum((old_clicks[a]/100)*unique_clicks[a]*x[a] for a in A) >= goal_unique_old)
```
Please note: the corrections are indicative and based on assumptions of the data. In real scenario, it is advisable to look at the input data and adjust factors accordingly to have all entities in the same scale.
       
                    If the solutions is not directly concretely making fast progress in achieving the goal, give it a lower score.
