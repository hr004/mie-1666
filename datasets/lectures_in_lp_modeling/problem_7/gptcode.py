It seems there's a misunderstanding. Unfortunately, no original Python code was provided in your message. The error message you provided suggests a syntax error due to an unterminated string literal, but without the original problematic code, it's not possible to provide a specific solution or correction.

If you could provide the original Python code that is causing this error, I would be able to better assist in identifying and correcting any issues present. Please ensure the code is correctly formatted when you provide it.
