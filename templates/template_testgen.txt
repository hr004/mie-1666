Given an optimization problem with the following details:

### PROBLEM TYPE:
 {PROBLEM_TYPE}

### PROBLEM INFO:
 {PROBLEM_INFO}

### INPUT FORMAT:
 {INPUT_FORMAT}

### OBJECTIVE:
 {OBJECTIVE}

### OUTPUT INFO:
 {OUTPUT_INFO}

### OUTPUT FORMAT:
 {OUTPUT_FORMAT}

A code reads the input from file called `data.json`, solves the problem, and writes the output in an `output.json` file. Develop a script that validates the generated output by checking for constraint violations and making sure the json format (keys) of the output is correct. I have a template for the test already:

{INITIAL_TEST_SCRIPT}

Complete the `run()` function of the script to perform the required validation checks as per the above requirements.

### **Requirements:**
1. **Checks:** Generate a bullet list of checks the script should perform.
2. **Script Modification:** Only modify the `run()` function in the provided initial test script.
3. **Return Value:** The `run()` function should return a list of strings indicating the errors in the output, or an empty list ([]) if the output is valid.
4. **Libraries:** Assume necessary libraries are already installed.
5. **Numerical Inaccuracy:** Use `eps` for all numerical comparisons (==, <=, <, >=, >) to account for any numerical inaccuracies. For instance, use x > -eps instead of x > 0.
6. **Error Messages:** Generate informative and descriptive error messages, using f-strings where appropriate, to convey what is wrong with the output.


### **Instructions:**
- Start with imports and generate the complete script.
- All keys read from the data file are strings and not integers.
- Wrap the code in markdown (```).

### **Task:**
Complete the `run()` function of the script to perform the required validation checks as per the above requirements.
