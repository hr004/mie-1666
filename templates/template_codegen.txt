Now, please generate a Python code using {SOLVER} to solve the formulated optimization problem. The code will read the problem data from a file named "data.json" and should save the output in a file named "output.json".


OUTPUT INFO: 
{OUTPUT_INFO}

your code should save the output as a file named "output.json" with indents of 4 spaces in this format:

{OUTPUT_FORMAT}

when writing the code, remember that
{SOLVER_INSTRUCTION}
- all keys that you read from the data file are strings and not integers
- try to keep the code for adding different constraints separate to avoid confusion
- ONLY generate the code, and don't generate anything else! I've already installed the necessary libraries.
- Wrap the code using markdown ```
- Write code in Python PEP 8 style
- Use 'model' as the name of the gurobi model object



### INSTRUCTIONS:
1. **Read Data**: Read all necessary data from "data.json". Remember, all keys in the data file are strings.
2. **Solver Instructions**: 
{SOLVER_INSTRUCTION}
3. **Code Structure**: Structure your code clearly, keeping the code for adding different constraints separate to maintain readability and avoid confusion.
4. **Output File**: Save the results in "output.json" using the specified format.
5. **Libraries**: Do not include installation of libraries; assume all necessary libraries are already installed.
6. **Markdown**: Wrap the generated code using markdown triple backticks (```) to maintain format.

Take a deep breath and work on this problem step by step.
