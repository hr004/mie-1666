Now we have defined variables for the problem. Good job!
We now have the following code that reads data and creates variables

```python
{CODE_AVAILABLE}
```

In the next step, generate Python code to create the constraints for the problem.
These constraints should be defined based on the formulation and the previous code that creates variables.

### INSTRUCTIONS:
1. **Constraint Creation**: Define the constraints based on the formulation and the variables you just created.
2. **Code Structure**: Structure your code clearly for constraint creation.
3. **Solver Instructions**: {SOLVER_INSTRUCTION}
4. **Style**: Use Python PEP8 standard to write the code
5. **Markdown**: Wrap the generated code using markdown triple backticks (```).

When writing the code, remember that

- Problem data has been read and variables have been created

### Example
Here's an example of creating constraints with {SOLVER}:

```python
{SOLVER_CONSTR_DEMO}
```

Take a deep breath and work on this problem step by step. Only generate the code relevant to the constraints!
