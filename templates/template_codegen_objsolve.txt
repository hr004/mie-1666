Now we have defined variables and constraints for the problem. Good job!
We now have the following code

```python
{CODE_AVAILABLE}
```

In the last step, generate Python code to define the objective function, solve the problem and output the results.
The code should save the output in a file named "output.json". The information you need to output is as follows:

OUTPUT INFO:
{OUTPUT_INFO}

your code should save the output as a file named "output.json" with indents of 4 spaces in this format:

{OUTPUT_FORMAT}

### INSTRUCTIONS:
1. **Solve the model**: Set the model objective based on the formulation, solve it, and obtain the results.
2. **Code Structure**: Structure your code clearly for solving the problem, including setting the objective and saving the results.
3. **Solver Instructions**:
{SOLVER_INSTRUCTION}
4. **Style**: Use Python PEP8 standard to write the code
5. **Markdown**: Wrap the generated code using markdown triple backticks (```).

When writing the code, remember that

- ONLY generate the code, and don't generate anything else!
- Combine the code you write and the code we already have

### Example
Here's an example of setting objective and solving the model with {SOLVER}.

```python
{SOLVER_SOLVE_DEMO}
```

Take a deep breath and work on this problem step by step. Again only generate code and do not make any comments!
