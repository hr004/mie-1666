Now, please generate Python code using {SOLVER} to solve the formulated optimization problem.
At this step, generate Python code to create the optimization variables for the problem.
These variables should be defined based on the problem data read from "data.json".

### INSTRUCTIONS:
1. **Read Data**: Read the necessary data from "data.json" (keys are strings).
2. **Variable Creation**: Define the variables based on the problem data, specifying their type (e.g., continuous, integer, binary), and any specific bounds or constraints.
3. **Code Structure**: Structure your code clearly for variable creation. Ensure that you use the appropriate syntax for defining variables using {SOLVER}.
4. **Solver Instructions**: {SOLVER_INSTRUCTION}
5. **Libraries**: Do not include the installation of libraries; assume all necessary libraries are already installed.
6. **Markdown**: Wrap the generated code using markdown triple backticks (```).


When writing the code, remember that

- all keys that you read from the data file are strings and not integers
- ONLY generate the code, and don't generate anything else!

### Example
Here's an example of declaring variables with {SOLVER}:

```python
{SOLVER_VAR_DEMO}
```

Take a deep breath and work on this problem step by step. Only generate codes relevant to variables, and no comment is needed
