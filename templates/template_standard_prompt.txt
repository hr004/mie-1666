I will give you an {PROBLEM_TYPE} optimization problem, and want you to write a {SOLVER} code to solve it.
The code you write will have access to the data for the problem in file "data.json".

PROBLEM_INFO:

{PROBLEM_INFO}

INPUT_FORMAT:

{INPUT_FORMAT}

+ variables represented by [ ] are lists of values.
+ names in quotes (") are keys and are exactly the same in the data file.
+ the other items are variables described in the problem description and are replaced with their values in the data file.

OBJECTIVE: {OBJECTIVE}

OUTPUT INFO: 
{OUTPUT_INFO}

your code should save the output as a file named "output.json" with indents of 4 spaces in this format:

{OUTPUT_FORMAT}

when writing the code, remember that
{SOLVER_INSTRUCTION}
- all keys that you read from the data file are strings and not integers
- ONLY generate one main code! I've already installed the necessary libraries.
